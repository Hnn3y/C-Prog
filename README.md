| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First Coding**          | Teaches `main()`, `#include`, basic output.      |
| **Comments**              | Teaches how to annotate and document code.                        |
| **Compiler Error**        | Before deep coding, you must understand what goes wrong.          |
| **Compiler Warnings**     | Helps avoid future bugs. Warnings often reveal bad habits.    |
| **Constants**             | Introduces `#define` and `const` — essential before logic.        |
| **Data Types**            | Core to understanding variables, memory, and type logic.          |
| **Booleans**              | Although not native in old C, it's important for control flow.    |
| **Function Declarations** | Prepares you to break large code into reusable blocks.            |
| **Function Parameters**   | Introduces input/output to/from functions.                        |
| **Function**              | Finally, you tie it all together by defining and using functions. |
