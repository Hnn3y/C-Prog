### 01_BEGINNER – Foundation Concepts
| Topic                     | Learning Objective                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First Coding**          | Teaches `main()`, `#include`, basic output.      |
| **Comments**              | Teaches how to annotate and document code.                        |
| **Compiler Error**        | Before deep coding, you must understand what goes wrong.          |
| **Compiler Warnings**     | Helps avoid future bugs. Warnings often reveal bad habits.    |
| **Constants**             | Introduces `#define` and `const` — essential before logic.        |
| **Data Types**            | Core to understanding variables, memory, and type logic.          |
| **Booleans**              | Although not native in old C, it's important for control flow.    |
| **Function Declarations** | Prepares you to break large code into reusable blocks.            |
| **Function Parameters**   | Introduces input/output to/from functions.                        |
| **Function**              | Finally, you tie it all together by defining and using functions. |

### 02_INTERMEDIATE – Control Flow and Logic
| **Topic**           | **Learning Objective**                                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `For Loops`         | Use `for` loops to repeat operations based on conditions and counters.       |
| `Break or Continue` | Control loop execution by skipping (`continue`) or exiting (`break`) early.  |
| `Arrays`            | Store and access indexed collections of data in a single variable.           |
| `C Structure`       | Create custom data types by grouping variables of different types.           |
| `C Enums`           | Define named integer constants to improve code readability and control flow. |
| `Pointers`          | Understand memory addresses and how to manipulate data directly.            |
| `Pointer Arithmetic` | Perform arithmetic operations on pointers to navigate memory.              |
| `Dynamic Memory`    | Allocate and free memory at runtime using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.   |
| `Function Pointers` | Use pointers to functions for dynamic behavior and callbacks.               |
| `C Preprocessor`   | Use preprocessor directives for conditional compilation and macros.         |

### 03_ADVANCED – File Handling and More
| **Topic**      | **Learning Objective**                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Create Files` | Learn file input/output: creating, reading, writing, and closing files using `FILE*`. |
| `Read Files`   | Read data from files into your program, handling different data formats.            |
| `Write Files`  | Write data to files, including formatted output.                                     |
| `File Pointers`| Understand how to use file pointers for efficient file operations.                   |
| `File Modes`   | Learn about different file modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, etc.) for file operations. |
| `Error Handling`| Implement error handling for file operations to ensure robustness.                   |
| `Command Line Args` | Pass arguments to your program via the command line for dynamic input.          |
| `Makefile`     | Use Makefiles to automate the build process, managing dependencies and compilation. |
| `Debugging`    | Learn debugging techniques using tools like `gdb` to troubleshoot your code.       |
| `Unit Testing` | Write unit tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.                        |
| `Memory Leaks` | Detect and fix memory leaks using tools like `valgrind` to ensure efficient memory usage. |
| `Concurrency`  | Understand basic concurrency concepts and how to use threads in C.                |
